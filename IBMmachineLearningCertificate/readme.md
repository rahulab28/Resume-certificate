This course covers key machine learning concepts and algorithms, including various types of classification and regression techniques. It explores linear and non-linear methods, such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), Logistic Regression, and Multiclass Prediction for classification tasks, and Linear Regression, Multiple Regression, and Regression Trees for predicting continuous values. You will learn to implement algorithms like K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Trees, and Regression Trees using Python libraries such as SciPy and scikit-learn. The course also emphasizes the evaluation of models using various metrics to assess the performance of simple and complex models.
