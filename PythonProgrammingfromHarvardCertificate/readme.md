CS50P: Introduction to Programming with Python is an introductory course designed for students with or without prior programming experience. This course focuses entirely on Python and covers core programming concepts such as functions, variables, conditionals, loops, exceptions, and unit testing. You will also learn how to work with third-party libraries, use regular expressions for data validation, and practice object-oriented programming (OOP) by modeling real-world entities with classes, objects, methods, and properties. Additionally, the course includes hands-on exercises and projects inspired by real-world programming problems, giving you ample opportunities to practice your skills.
