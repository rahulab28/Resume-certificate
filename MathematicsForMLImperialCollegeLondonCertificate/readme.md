This specialization bridges the gap between foundational mathematics and its application in Machine Learning and Data Science. It begins with a Linear Algebra course, introducing vectors and matrices and their relevance to data. The Multivariate Calculus course builds on this, focusing on optimizing functions for data fitting. The third course, Dimensionality Reduction with Principal Component Analysis (PCA), applies the concepts learned to compress high-dimensional data. The specialization includes hands-on assignments, where you will apply these mathematical concepts using Python to solve real-world problems like calculating page rank, training neural networks, performing regression, and analyzing the MNIST dataset.

Skills Gained:

Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors: Understanding their role in data transformation.
Principal Component Analysis (PCA): Applying PCA for dimensionality reduction.
Multivariable Calculus: Optimizing models and training algorithms.
Linear Algebra: Mastery of vectors and matrices in data science applications.
