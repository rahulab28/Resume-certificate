During my internship, I worked on a gender detection project using iris analysis. I applied computer vision techniques like Canny edge detection and image normalization, and implemented a CNN model in PyTorch for gender classification. I also explored Deep Belief Networks and Restricted Boltzmann Machines for iris analysis, enhancing my skills in CNNs, computer vision, and classification.
