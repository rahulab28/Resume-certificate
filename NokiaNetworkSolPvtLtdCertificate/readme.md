overview of the internship 
I am thrilled to share that I have successfully completed a data science internship at Nokia, where I contributed to building a comprehensive data lake by integrating data from multiple sources. My responsibilities included performing exploratory data analysis, enhancing data quality through preprocessing, and feature engineering. One key accomplishment was designing and implementing a time series model using LSTM architecture. Throughout my internship, I focused on identifying impactful KPIs that supported informed decision-making in the telecommunications industry. Additionally, I led efforts to monitor the performance of individual cells, directly contributing to improvements in customer connectivity.
